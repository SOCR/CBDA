-DONE
1) Created the function 'ipak.R' that groups together all the packages needed, checks if they are installed,
   installs them if needed and loads them. Made a key change to mirror the correct CRAN site for installation
   on the socr-pipeline server.

2) Implement a function ('prodNA', part of the missForest package for imputation) that set a % of missing values (i.e., misValperc)
   in each dataset used by SuperLearner

3) Added the packages MICE, Amelia, missForest, Hmisc, mi for imputation.For now we are using missForest for testing
   (likely has the best performance) [see this website for reference
    http://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/03/tutorial-powerful-packages-imputing-missing-values/)

4) Moved the imputation (performed with missForest now) and normalization (now done with scale instead of rescale, easier implementation)
    outside the SuperLearner loop (saves a LOT of CPU time).

6) Added the new ALS dataset to the DATA CBDA repository.

7) Running 15 CBDA-SL experiments on socr-pipeline server, combining missing values (misValperc: 0% / 10% / 20% / 30% / 40%)
   and column subsets (kcol: 5-15% / 15-30% / 30-50%). Each experiment has 10,000 iteration, and runs in batch mode, saving
   a "light" workspace that we will use in the post analysis to compare the covariate selections under these different conditions.

TO DO

1) Allow for multiple options for imputation methods to be used.

2) Fix the labeling bug in the histogram plots (now the plots are with densities and not absolute counts)
 
3) Start to generate a list of wrappers to make the SL.library more comprehensive,
   and select one or two classes of prediction algorithms (e.g., glm, glmnet)
   to be expanded with many options with the wrappers

4) Need to apply CBDA algorithm with SuperLearner the ALS dataset, after cleaning and harmonization is performed.
