Prediction algorithms
Algorithms that take as input X and
Y and return a predicted Y value.

Screening algorithms
Algorithms designed to reduce the
dimension of X. They take as input X and Y and return a
logical vector indicating the columns in X passing the
screening. Screening algorithms can be coupled with
prediction algorithms to form new prediction algorithms
