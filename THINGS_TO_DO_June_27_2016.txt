1) Define the packages for imputation to be used
  (see this website for reference --> 
   http://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/03/tutorial-powerful-packages-imputing-missing-values/)

2) Move the rescaling/normalization step inside the SL LOOP

3) Fix the labeling bug in the histogram plots (now the plots are with densities and not absolute counts)

4) Making the SL objects "lighter", so we don't need to save workspaces of many GBs
   if M=10K and more than 20-30 algorithm variants are used
   
5) Start to generate a list of wrappers to make the SL.library more comprehensive

6) Start to analyze (cleaning, harmonization,..) the new dataset Ivo sent
